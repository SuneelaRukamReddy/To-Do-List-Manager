kg = pounds × 0.45359237
``` :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### 🧠 What It Does

- **Real-time conversion**: As you type, the script calculates weight every second and displays it with two decimal precision.
- **Input validation**: Negative values trigger a brief error message ("Please enter a valid number.") and clear the output. This resets after a few seconds to maintain a clean interface.
- **Auto-clear**: After showing a valid output, the result is automatically cleared after 10 seconds, making the UI neat and ready for new entries. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

### 🧩 Why It Matters

- Enables quick, on-the-fly weight conversion between common measurement systems.
- Ideal for everyday users—like travelers, fitness enthusiasts, or students—who frequently switch between pounds and kilograms.
- Focused on simplicity, usability, and clean design, it’s a great beginner-friendly project demonstrating core web technologies: **HTML**, **CSS** (with Tailwind and Bootstrap), and **JavaScript**.

### 📚 Technical Summary

- **UI**: A single-page interface using `<input>` fields for entry, `<span>` for displaying results, and `<p>` tags for error messages.
- **Conversion Logic**: JavaScript listens for input events, validates data, and applies the conversion formula with `toFixed(2)` for precision.
- **UX Features**:
  - Displays clear error feedback for invalid inputs.
  - Clears outputs after 10 seconds (valid) or 2 seconds (error), ensuring the interface is always ready for next use. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
